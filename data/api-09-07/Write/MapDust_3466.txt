OpenStreetMap bug tracker
MapDust
Based on the OpenStreetMap project data, MapDust helps identify bugs in the user-contributed data. Applications can build MapDust into their maps so that users can see areas that need fixing, or add new bugs to the system. The service is in private beta, but openly discussed in the OpenStreetMap community. In December 2010, MapQuest incorporated it into its open mapping sites.
