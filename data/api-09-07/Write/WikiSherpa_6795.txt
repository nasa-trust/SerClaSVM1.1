Travel guides lookup service
WikiSherpa
WikiSherpa gives mobile users an interfact to Wikitravel that lets them download and navigate Wikitravel pages on their iPhone or Android phone, and shows their listings on a map. WikiSherpa is a mash-up of Wikitravel, Wikipedia, and OpenStreetMap. It can be used to search for destination guides which can be saved to users&#039; phones. The API lets users access the functionality including returning a complete Wikitravel page, searching for pages, returning a list of pages nearest the given lat/long coordinates and more. The API uses HTTP calls and responses are formatted in JSON.
