Photo sharing and discovery service
EyeEm
EyeEm is a photo-sharing and discovery app that allows users to connect through their photos. EyeEm categorizes photos by subject and location, and take the data from a user&#039;s own photos to recommend albums of similar photos of friends and like-minded people.

The API gives users access to much of EyeEm???s current functionality, including acquiring user photos, albums, favorites, likes and comments, as well as topics and photo tags by city, country, venue and by event. API documentation can be accessed upon registration.
