Google Translator Toolkit 
Translator Toolkit is a WYSIWYG editor that enables translators to bring a human touch to machine translation through translation search, bilingual dictionaries, and custom terminology databases. Users can share their translations with other users and download others&#039; translations onto their own desktop.

The Google Translator Toolkit Data API allows client applications to access and update translation-related data programmatically. This includes translation document, translation memory, and glossary data stored with Google Translator Toolkit.
