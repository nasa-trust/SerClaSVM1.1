Simple online mapping service
MapQuest Static Map
The Static Map API allows you to customize and create your own map image through a simple HTTP request.  Maps can be centered by requesting a center point, a bounding box, or allowing the service to best-fit all the features shown on the map.  Custom icons are also accepted and can be decluttered for overlapping POIs.
