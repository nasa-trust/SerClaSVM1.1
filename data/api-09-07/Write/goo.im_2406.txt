Android-related file sharing service
goo.im
Goo.im (formerly Goo-INsi) is a file mirroring site, hosting mainly Android-related files. It provides a place for users to upload and download files to be used with their mobile devices for free. The site now mirrors official CyanogenMod builds, hundreds of ROMs, radio and firmware updates, and other miscellaneous files used for the development and rooting of Android devices.

The goo.im API provides a JSON feed that can be used to show a list of selected ROMs on a website or to provide a continuously updated Google apps listing.
