Time tracking services
RescueTime
From their site: RescueTime is built with the idea that you shouldn&#039;t have to come to RescueTime.com to view your data, and you should not necessarily have to use our data collector to add data to the system. RescueTime is a web-based time-management tool that allows you to easily understand how you spend your time. One of the coolest things about RescueTime is that there is no data entry. You install a doohicky on your computer and we magically track all of your time usage. NOTE: No API docs publicly available.
