Creative Commons Music Podcasts Service
CCHits
CCHits promots Creative Commons licensed music by highlighting the artists who make it and the people who play it. The CCHits API provides access to the site&#039;s collection of podcasts and supporting websites, the data driving the CCHits site.

Simple JSON requests provide access to various querying options. Developers can search by artists and tracks. There is a writable option to add a track to a particular podcast show, as well.

The API also has additional features for querying for information provided by HTTP status codes, as well as a set of functions meant to be called from shell scripts.
