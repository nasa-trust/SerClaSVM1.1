Service and network for open source collaboration 
Cofundos
Cofundos helps developers realize open-source software ideas by providing a platform for their discussion development by establishing a process for organizing the contributions and interests of different stakeholders in the idea. It lets you bring project ideas to the site, bid to pay for that project, and then letting community members skilled in that realm offer their services to complete the project for a certain sum of money. Then the project is voted about whether it was successfully completed and then the bid money is given. The site specializes in community innovation and funding. Numerous feeds are available, but there is also a Cofundos API available for use. Send an email to obtain more information.
