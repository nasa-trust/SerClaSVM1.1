RSS feed management and filtering service
BlastCasta Feed
Use the BlastCasta Feed API to get feed modifying services. For example, combine multiple feeds into one feed, sort feeds, filter feeds, translate a feed from one language to another, convert a feed from RSS to Atom, remove HTML tags, and suppress images in feeds. As part of filtering, you might use the API to set a max limit on the number of feed items in the output feed. As part of the sorting functionality, you might sort by title, published date, author, or randomly.
