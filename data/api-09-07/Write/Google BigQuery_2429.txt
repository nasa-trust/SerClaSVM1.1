Large dataset querying service
Google BigQuery
The Google BigQuery service allows users to run SQL-like queries against very large datasets, with potentially billions of rows. BigQuery works best for interactive analyses, typically using a small number of very large, append-only tables. Users can access BigQuery using the BigQuery browser, the bq command-line tool, the REST API, or Google Apps Script.
