Services for document approval and review
Approver
From their site: If anyone&#039;s ever sent you a document to review in email, you know the experience pretty much sucks. Where&#039;d the document go that the vice president asked me to look at three weeks ago and what&#039;s the deadline for getting back to him? Who else is reviewing this document and what are their comments? In all likelihood, the answers to these questions are buried at the bottom of some nightmarish pile of???email. Approver.com fixes all that by letting you create or upload documents on a web site that you can share with friends or co-workers. You get alerts when interesting events in the lifetime of a document take place, and you can monitor your document queue using simple, sanitary RSS.
