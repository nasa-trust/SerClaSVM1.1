New Zealand parcel tracking service
New Zealand Post Tracking
The service from New Zealand Post tracks parcel delivery for most categories of packages carried by the postal network. It is intended for integration with e-commerce websites and other applications that need parcel tracking. Tracking notification and shipping/rate lookup APIs also are available.

Tracking API methods support submission of a single tracking code or multiple codes in a single request. Methods are available to submit mock requests without valid tracking codes to verify service output and to simulate various error conditions to help program application responses.
