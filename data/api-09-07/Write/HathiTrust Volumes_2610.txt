Library catalogue information retrieval service
HathiTrust Volumes
The HathiTrust Volumes API allows the user to retrieve information about volumes deposited in the HathiTrust Digital Library. Given a standard identifier for a known item, the API returns basic metadata for that item. This API is intended to be a simple and fast way to help people inline data from HathiTrust into their own OPAC or similar system.

This is an unofficial API and is not owned, maintained, or endorsed by HathiTrust Digital Library.
