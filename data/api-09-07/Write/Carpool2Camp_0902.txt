Carpooling service for transportation to camp
Carpool2Camp
The service helps families to share transportation of campers to remote locations. Applications can embed the functions to collect starting locations and destinations, then match submissions with similar routes. Campers&#039; families can then coordinate trips between home and camp to reduce traffic, driving expense, and carbon emissions.

API methods support embedding proprietary the PoolPass?? and Ride Match functionality into a camp web site. The API manages the database of ride requests as well as geolocation and ride-matching. Account admin functions provide records for a specific camp and create new user accounts.
