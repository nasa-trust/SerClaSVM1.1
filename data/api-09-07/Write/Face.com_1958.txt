Face Recognition
Face.com
The face.com API offer services for detecting, recognizing, and tagging faces in any photo, through a REST API. Developers can tag and recognize users from Facebook or Twitter. Alternatively, you can train our index with your own set of users in a private namespace. Saving Facebook and Twitter tags improves recognition for you and others, and it qualifies you for better rate limits.
