Integration service for TeleNav maps
TeleNav AJAX Maps
The TeleNav AJAX Maps API allows developers to integrate TeleNav&#039;s online maps into their own Web applications. This API uses Javascript and DHTML to allow developers to mashup their applications with TeleNav maps. The maps services are supplied through a TMapService object, which provides the services of geocoding, reverse-geocoding, and routing search.
