Peptide sequence alignment consensus visualization
IceLogo
IceLogo is a program that generates a sequence logo for aligned peptide sequences. A sequence logo is a histogram-like presentation in which the bars are vertical stacks of symbols. Stack height reflects the level of pattern conservation in aligned peptide sequences, and the height of individual symbols is a measure of their frequency at a given position.

Unlike other sequence logo generating programs that rely on Shannon???s information theory, IceLogo operates based on probability theory. Basically, the algorithm takes the experimental set and compares it with a reference set, which can be configured by the user. These two sets are used in a probability analysis, and the results are shown in the resulting sequence logo.

IceLogo&#039;s functions are freely available as an API using the SOAP protocol.
