Store location search service
Bullseye Store Locator
The Bullseye Store Locator makes it easy to deploy a local dealer or store search tool for businesses with multiple locations. The Bullseye Store Locator API provides a programmable interface to search for locations by zip or postal code with radius, or city/state and radius. You can retrieve data about specific stores in the results and filter search results by categories. An account needs to be set up in Bullseye in order to begin testing.  Contact Electric Vine for details.
