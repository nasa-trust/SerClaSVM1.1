MapBox
MapBox is a suite of open source mapping tools. This API can be used to create interactive maps using a wide range of file formats and databases. It also allows users to host their maps so that they can be embedded on webpages and shared with a wider audience. All maps created using MapBox are compatible with Android and iOS devices.
