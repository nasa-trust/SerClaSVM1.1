Twitter post archiving service
Tweet Archivist
Tweet Archivist is a service that lets users search Twitter for Tweets by sender, recipient, object of reference, or contents. Users may then create an archive based on that search which they can analyze, export, and share. Users may choose to keep the search private or share the results with friends, colleagues, or the world. Users may create a maximum of three active archives.

The Tweet Archivist API enables users to visualize the data collected in their archives. Available visualizations include volume over time, top users, Tweet vs. Retweet, top words, top URLs, and source of Tweets.
