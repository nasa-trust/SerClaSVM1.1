Hotel reservation service
TripAuthority
XML API from Alliance Reservations Network for hotel availability, rate details, bookings, and cancellations. The API provides tools for an experienced developer to implement the back end for a hotel reservation booking engine: integration with static content and search interface, availability request with rate information (including multiple currency display), request for detailed information, reservation request, and canceling a reservation.
