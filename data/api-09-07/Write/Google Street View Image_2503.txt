Street view image service
Google Street View Image
Google&#039;s Street View Image API lets users retrieve Street View panorama or thumbnail images with parameterized HTTP requests. This web service allows these images to be embedded into a web page, without the use of JavaScript.

The viewport size, direction, location, pitch, and field of view (fov) can all be manipulated by parameters included in the HTTP request. Since the size of the image and the fov can be specified, users can effectively control the zoom level of the image. Finally, there is a parameter that can specify the request is coming from a device with location sensor information, enabling the service to be integrated with, for example, GPS enabled mobile phones.
