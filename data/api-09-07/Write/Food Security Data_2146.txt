Food Security Data
The Food Security Data API provides means for downloading data and charts from FoodSecurityPortal.com. The site aggregates monthly economic, human well-being, food security, and other data from various indices. The API is based around Query builder which allows the user to create a unique request that will return only the data set wanted. This can then be integrated into existing applications, mashups, or simply used to pull selected data.
