Pushpin
Pushpin is a web mapping api offering advanced GIS features such as custom layers and thematic maps. Developers can use Pushpin to display simple maps, but it is most powerful with the additional layers and display options. Add layers of data from other services directly within Pushpin, which includes regional shapes that can be used in thematic maps where multiple areas are shaded in different colors.
