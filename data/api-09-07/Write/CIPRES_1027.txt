CIPRES
The CIPRES project is a multi-site collaboration for Phyloinformatics and Computational Phylogenetics. The goal of the CIPRES project was to enable large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions on a scale that supports analyses of huge data sets containing hundreds of thousands of bio molecular sequences. The REST API provides web services for end users to submit a job to the portal programmatically. Currently, only one job submission is allowed for each request. The REST API provides the same functionality as those provided by the browser-based service. The API uses XML for its return format.
