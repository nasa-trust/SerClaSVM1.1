Multiple sequence alignment service
CBRC MAFFT
CBRC MAFFT is a multiple sequence alignment program for amino acids and nucleotides. Users must input the sequences they wish to align in FASTA format. A number of advanced settings are available, including style of alignment (constrained by speed and the number of sequences), scoring matrix parameters, and the use of homologs. CBRC MAFFT&#039;s functions can be accessed programmatically via SOAP API.
