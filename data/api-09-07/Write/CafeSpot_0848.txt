Social guide to cafes
CafeSpot
From their site: CafeSpot is a social guide to independent cafes, coffee shops, restaurants, and more. This project was conceived of as a way to highlight and share those great local spots that are frequently only discovered via word of mouth. Being a social guide, CafeSpot allows you to both contribute and to explore the preferences and recommendations of other people.
