Stocklytics Intraday Historical Stock Prices
Stocklytics provides stock market data of all sorts, from ticker symbol quotes with charts, to news and even Twitter results about the particular stock. The three major US markets are supported: NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE.

The Intraday Historical Prices API allows users to get a list of the price for a particular stock for the current day (or the latest day of trading if markets are closed) in 5 minute intervals. With this data, users can generate intraday stock graphs, or perform stock analysis in near real-time. Data for this API is updated every 5 minutes. The Stocklytics API makes the Stocklytics data available as a RESTful API with JSON and CSV output.
