SMS messaging service
Kinross Group
The Kinross Group provides a web-to-mobile system for sending and receiving structured messages to and from mobile phones. These messages can be &#039;structured&#039; so that the presentation of the message to the user is done via a customizable form, and that the message content is delivered or sent via XML to external systems.

The Kinross Group API provides methods for sending and receiving messages, as well as managing user accounts and templates, using SOAP and XML.
