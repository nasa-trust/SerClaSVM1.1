Q&A social network
Formspring
Formspring is a social network for asking and answering questions. Registration is free and is required to participate.

The Formspring API allows users and developers to interact with Formspring data and functionality, and to pull content into other clients and services, or integrate social Q&A with external websites. Formspring uses a REST-like API that returns responses in XML or JSON formats.
