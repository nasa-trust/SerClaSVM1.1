Lemonade Stand
Lemonade Stand is a new way to buy and sell locally, a neighborly commerce platform that enables people to buy and sell goods within a community. Anyone can post a listing and other users can search locally available products. Lemonade Stand provides a simple HTTP GET/POST/PUT API, allowing developers to create their own applications that can interact with Lemonade Stand.
