OpenDOAR
From their site: OpenDOAR is constructing a comprehensive and authoritative list of institutional and subject-based repositories. The API is a machine-to-machine interface that lets third party applications run a wide variety of queries against the OpenDOAR Database and get back XML data. You can choose to receive just repository titles & URLs (suitable for OAI-PMH harvesting), or all the available OpenDOAR data, or intermediate levels of detail.
