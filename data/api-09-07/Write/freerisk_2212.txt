Risk modeling service
freerisk
Freerisk is a project with the goal of making freely available the data, algorithms and tools necessary to perform risk modeling. This RESTful API allows users to create risk metrics. It acts as a credit risk calculator composed of a set of web calls and responses are formatted in JSON.
