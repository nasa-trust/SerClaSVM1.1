Online SCUBA Diving Logbook
Dive.io
Dive.io is an online social service where SCUBA divers can post information about dives they have completed and places they dive. Other users can then browse dive records and see other user&#039;s opinions on the dives. Dive.io also provides a RESTful API allowing developers to create their own applications and websites for accessing Dive.io data and uploading/retrieving dive records.
