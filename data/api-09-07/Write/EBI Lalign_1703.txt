Local pairwise sequence alignment service
EBI Lalign
Lalign is a program for the local pairwise alignment of DNA and protein sequences. It finds internal duplications by calculating non-intersecting local alignments in the two sequences input by the user for analysis. The European Bioinformatics institute makes these functions available as an API via SOAP or REST protocols.
