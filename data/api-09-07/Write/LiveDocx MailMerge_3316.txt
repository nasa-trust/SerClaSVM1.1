Document creation service
LiveDocx MailMerge
LiveDocx is a template-based document creation service. It allows developers to create word processing documents by combining user-defined Microsoft Word templates with data from disparate sources, such as XML files and databases. It is typically used to create professional, print-ready documents in DOCX, DOC, RTF, or PDF format. The LiveDocx API makes these functions available programmatically via SOAP calls.
