Gasoline price information service
MyGasFeed
The service provides frequently updated reports of automotive fuel prices (gasoline in three grades and diesel) for specified locations or regions. It also provides locations of gas stations near a specified location along with background information about the stations, if desired. Applications can also update the service&#039;s pricing data for a particular station. Location information supports mapping protocols.

API methods support requesting fuel price information for a specified location or area. Methods also support retrieving a list of stations and details about an individual station. The API also supports updating the service&#039;s information with new pricing for an existing station or addition of a new station to the database.
