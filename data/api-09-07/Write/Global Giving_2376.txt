Online donation and causes marketplace
Global Giving
GlobalGiving is an online marketplace that connects you to the causes and countries you care about. You select the projects you want to support, make a tax-deductible contribution, and get regular progress updates - so you can see your impact.

GlobalGiving API is based on a set of RESTful web-services through HTTPS which provides the simplest and quickest way to access information for GlobalGiving projects and to submit a donation.
