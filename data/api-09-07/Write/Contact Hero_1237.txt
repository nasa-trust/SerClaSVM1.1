Contact Hero
Use the Contact Hero API to manage contact information, notes, calls, messages and contact photos. Contact Hero is a new contact manager and address book built from the ground up for mobile devices like Blackberry or iPhone. Integrate your ContactHero data with an existing or new app, display ContactHero data in your business system, and send updated data back to ContactHero from your app. With the API, you have access to the same functionality as your user type when logged in to the ContactHero site.
