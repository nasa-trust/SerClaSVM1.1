Data transportation layer
Simperium 
Simperium is a data -moving layer for developers. It transports JSON data between any entities assigned to it. This includes between apps, web to mobile, person to person, and backend to frontend.  It also allows multiple users to work on the same data simultaneously. Their RESTful API exposes full access to the data manipulation and transportation services. It returns JSON-encoded data. The service is currently free in its beta period and will evolve into a freemium tiered pay structure.
