iScore Sports Team Website
iScore sports creates ESPN affiliated apps for baseball/softball, basketball, and football. Additionally, iScore also provides websites and stat-recording services for individual teams of any level.

The iScore Sports Team Website API provides those who have purchased an iScore Team Website with a variety of methods for retrieving information from the website. The API allows users to get information about a team&#039;s roster, individual games, or player-specific statistics.

This API operates over HTTP and returns data as XML. Access is restricted to those with a Team Website account; users can create a password using their iSports account, which must be included in each API call.
