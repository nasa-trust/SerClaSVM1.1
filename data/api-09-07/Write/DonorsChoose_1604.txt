An online charity connecting you to classrooms in need
DonorsChoose
DonorsChoose.org is an online charity that makes it easy for anyone to help students in need.

Here&#039;s how it works: public school teachers from every corner of America post classroom project requests on DonorsChoose.org. Requests range from pencils for a poetry writing unit, to violins for a school recital, to microscope slides for a biology class.

Then, you can browse project requests and give any amount to the one that inspires you. Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.

You&#039;ll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you&#039;ll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.

DonorsChoose.org&#039;s simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.

The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.

The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.
