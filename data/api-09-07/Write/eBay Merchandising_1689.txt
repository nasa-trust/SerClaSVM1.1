eBay item and product recommendation service
eBay Merchandising
The eBay Merchandising API retrieves relevant information about products or item listings on eBay to help users sell more merchandise to eBay buyers. 

This API can be used to create applications that provide suggested products or item listings based on buyers&#039; searching or selection activity. Sellers can also use this API to augment their own listings with cross-promotions for their users.
