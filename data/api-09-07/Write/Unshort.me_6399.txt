Link unshortening service
Unshort.me
Unshort.me is a link unshortening service. Unshort.me allows users to unshorten links that are shortened through URL shortening services, such as Bit.ly, TinyURL, and Ow.ly.

The Unshort.me API allows developers to integrate the Unshort.me functionality into other applications, allowing for links to be unshortened. Documentation and information on what the API can do are very limited.
