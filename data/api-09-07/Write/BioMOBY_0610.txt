Plant genome reference service
BioMOBY
BioMOBY is a system for interoperability between plant genome databases and analytical services. 

MOBY-S is BioMOBY&#039;s web services branch. The MOBY-S API uses the SOAP and XML-RCP protocol and returns responses in XML. It has two major parts.

The registry API describes how to interact with the MOBY Central registry. MOBY Central stores the object and services ontologies, and provides discovery services for service consumers.

The service API describes how to interact with a service provided under the MOBY framework: it describes what messages you can send to a service, how should they be structured, how the service should interpret them, and what the proper responses are.
