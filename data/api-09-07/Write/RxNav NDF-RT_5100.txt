Drug and medication terminology service
RxNav NDF-RT
The service provides programmatic access to the current National Drug File - Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) data set. The NDF-RT articulates a standard vocabulary, or reference terminology, for the list of medications recognized by the U.S. Veterans Administration (VA). It establishes a formal description format and ontology for therapeutic drugs to encourage consistent terminology across providers and applications.

API methods support queries for all medications or subgroups of the full list, including associated compounds and those with parent-child relationships. Methods also support specification of drug properties and interactions.
