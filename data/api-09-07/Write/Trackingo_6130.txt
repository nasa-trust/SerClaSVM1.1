Personal Data Tracking Service
Trackingo
Trackingo is a website where users can track their personal data and generate graphs and information about that data. Users can track anything from football scores, weight, money and free time, to anything else they come up with.  The Trackingo API is an XML-RPC API that allows developers to get data from and push data to Trackingo (currently, there are no methods to edit data). Developers can develop their own basic applications around the Trackingo service with the Trackingo API.
