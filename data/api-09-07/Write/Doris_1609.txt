Personal productivity and task management
Doris
Doris is a hosted service designed to let you keep track of the things you need to get done, wherever you are. Doris provides productivity and task management services like:

- Delegation: assign tasks to people in your team
- Email integration: that&#039;s where we&#039;ve found most tasks originate
- Basecamp/Trac integration: integrate Doris with your existing workflow

The majority of Doris data and functionality are exposed via its Application Programming Interface (API). The REST based  lets developers create Doris-based apps or integrate Doris with their existing development workflow.
