Personal task list service
Google Tasks
Google Tasks provides a to-do list system for users within GMail, Calendar, iGoogle home page and a direct mobile site. The Google Tasks API provides developers with a set of API endpoints for searching, reading, and updating Google Tasks content and metadata. With the API a user can retrieve, update, delete and create task lists as well as retrieve, update, order, delete and create tasks.

The service is currently in Google Labs, so it&#039;s considered to be in beta. The API uses RESTful calls and responses are formatted in JSON.
