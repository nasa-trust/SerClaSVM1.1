Sports news and information service
FanFeedr Sports News
The FanFeedr API is a flexible content platform that allows developers to customize news, photos, video, scores, tweets, and other information for athletes, teams, leagues, and events.

Our platform provides aggregated sports news and data for 55,000 athletes and 4,000 teams from over 8,000 sources. 
 
Our API can be queried by entity, content type, keyword, time period, &#039;hotness&#039;, and geolocation to create engaging user experiences and applications.

While basic API access is free, paid services are also available for developers who require higher rate limits, access to the original URL&#039;s of news items, or email and phone support.
