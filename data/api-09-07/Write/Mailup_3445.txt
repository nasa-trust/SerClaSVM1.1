Broadcast email service
Mailup
The service enables broadcast email, including creating messages and managing campaigns and address lists. User content flows into provided templates or employs user-supplied html formatting. It helps coordinate email messaging with social media involvement and provides reporting and tracking tools to monitor campaign activity.

API methods support basic content upload and message send as well as management of address lists including opt in/opt out and message send status. Available methods handle SMS messaging and social media posting, too.
