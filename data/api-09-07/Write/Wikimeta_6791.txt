Semantic tagging and content annotation service
Wikimeta
The service adds functions for annotation and semantic tagging of online content. It enables a user to apply free-text tags or longer text descriptions to content, which then is available for access by text-mining and content analysis applications. The service supports both local access and external access by other systems, with annotations in English or French, including full compatibility with LinkedData Network applications.

API methods support submission of annotations with documents, with language and annotation size specified. The system then supports automated access to accumulated content annotations via linked data technologies.
