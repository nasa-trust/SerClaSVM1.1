Genome sequence analysis service
G-language GAE
G-language Genome Analysis Environment (G-language GAE) is a set of Perl libraries for genome sequence analysis. It includes more than 100 original analysis programs and tends to focus on bacterial genome analysis. Programs are provided for identifying binding sites, analyzing nucleotide composition bias, analyzing the distribution of oligonucleotides, analyzing codons and predicted expression levels, and visualizing genomic information.

These functions are offered via REST and SOAP APIs to promote interoperability with other programming languages and bioinformatics software tools.
