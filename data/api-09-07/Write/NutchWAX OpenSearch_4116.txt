NutchWAX OpenSearch
The WWWoH project is an attempt to establish a possible framework for e-Humanities (also called Digital Humanities) research using available open source tools and technologies and archived web content.

OpenSearch is a collection of formats for the sharing of search results. The idea is that a search engine can be queried via a URL and the results are in XML format.
