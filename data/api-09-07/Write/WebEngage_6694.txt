Custom pop-up questionnaire service
WebEngage
WebEngage is a feedback and support tool that allows users to create custom questionnaires for their websites. These questionnaires can be programmed to pop up under certain conditions, such as if a visitor followed a specific link to the website or has spent more than a minute on the same page. WebEngage can be controlled using a JavaScript API.
