Media interfacing service
Joomeo
Joomeo is a personal media sharing application which allows you to upload content, organize it, and share it at your discretion. The Joomeo API uses XML-RPC to allows uses to create their own applications around the content on Joomeo as well as access the pictures and albums they have uploaded.
