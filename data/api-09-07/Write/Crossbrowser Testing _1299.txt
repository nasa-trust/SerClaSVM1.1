Website-browser compatibility testing 
Crossbrowser Testing 
CrossBrowser Testing is a service that allows website developers to test their pages. Developers tell the CrossBrowser Testing what browser and what operating system it should simulate. They can then run a live trial from their own computer browsers and remote VNC sessions. They offer two APIs: Automated Screenshot and Live Test. With the Automated Screenshots API, developers write their own screen capturing scripts. The Live Test API allows developers to configure their trial runs. Both are RESTful APIs and return XML and JSON data.
