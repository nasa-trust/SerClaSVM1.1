Amino acid, RNA, or DNA sequence alignment service
Divide-and-Conquer Multiple Sequence Alignment
Divide-and-Conquer Multiple Sequence Alignment (DCA) is a program for producing fast, high quality, simultaneous multiple alignments of amino acid, RNA, or DNA sequences. The program is based on an algorithm that provides a heuristic approach to sum-of-pairs optimal alignment.

DCA is available as a download, a web console, and a SOAP API.
