Business compliance management service
Fragmento
Fragmento is a process fragment repository that facilitates compliance management for process-based applications. Increasingly, companies must adhere to requirements from laws, regulations, and internal policies regarding business process management. Fragmento helps users achieve compliance through process-awareness, that is, by breaking processes down into discrete fragments that can be made compliant (and reused in other processes when appropriate).
