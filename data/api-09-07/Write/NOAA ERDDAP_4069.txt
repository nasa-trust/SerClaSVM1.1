Oceanic science data service
NOAA ERDDAP
This data service provides a combined interface to access and download scientific datasets and subsets on oceanography in common file formats. Typical uses involve charting and mapping. ERDDAP presents a single format for accessing multiple repositories, which the service reformats to interact with the remote server hosting the desired data.

API methods support retrieving a list of available resource URLs, resource categories, and datasets, as well as metadata describing those resources. Methods also allow both full-text and advanced search against the datasets.
