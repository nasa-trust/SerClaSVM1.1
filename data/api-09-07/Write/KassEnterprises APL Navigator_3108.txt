KassEnterprises APL Navigator
The APL Navigator provides on-demand access to Check Free APL reports over the web. APL Navigator provides a simple API for retrieving portfolio accounting data as XML documents using the APL Navigator engine and the SOAP standard. 

Using SOAP calls developers can access portfolio holdings (position and tax lots), transactions, gain-loss, and performance data sets, even access a firm&#039;s PDF reports. Additionally APL SOAP can manage user access via database level services from APL Navigator for requests such as authenticating users, or finding out what accounts a user has access to. APL SOAP is currently composed of three services: an APL Report Service, an APL Message Service, and an APL Navigator Database Service. Calls are secured over HTTPS and responses are formatted in XML.
