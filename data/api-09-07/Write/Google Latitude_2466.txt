Location sharing service
Google Latitude
The Google Latitude API allows for websites and developers to integrate with Google Latitude, which lets users update and read their current location, their location history, and other geo-related information. 

In Latitude, a location is a record of where a user was at a given time. A location always contains a latitude, a longitude and a timestamp. It might also contain more details about the position of the user at that time, such as altitude, or metadata about how the position itself was captured, such as accuracy.

A user typically has a current location, which represents the most recent known position of the user. In some cases, however, a user might decide to temporarily hide, making their position invisible to Latitude friends. A hidden user has no current location.

A user can opt to have their locations stored as a time series by Google. This collection of positions is called the user&#039;s location history.
