Web OS application development platform
SaasGrid
Use the SaasGrid API to access a platform for developing your Web apps. Similarly to how an operating system abstracts intricacies away from the apps it hosts, SaaSGrid tries to abstract many functions away from apps it hosts. SaaSGrid is made by Apprenda for its ISVs and gives you standard SaaS architecture items such as multi-tenancy, scalability, and automatic provisioning as part of the platform.
