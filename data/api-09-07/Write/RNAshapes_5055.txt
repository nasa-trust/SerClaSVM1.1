RNA shape prediction service
RNAshapes
Given an RNA sequence, RNAshapes can help determine its probable shape. RNAshapes computes a small set of representative structures of different shapes as well as accumulated shape probabilities. It also offers comparative predictions of consensus structures.

RNAshapes is available as a web console, a downloadable program, and a SOAP API.
