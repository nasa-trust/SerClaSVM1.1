Cloud-based spreadsheet service
Dirigible
Dirigible is a programmable, cloud-based spreadsheet. As well as traditional spreadsheet formulae, users can put Python code in each cell. Thus, a cell can hold objects, lists, or even references to functions. If custom calculations are required, a code editor embedded in the page can change the way the spreadsheet is recalculated. All Dirigible spreadsheets have an associated JSON URL, which allows them to be integrated into websites.
