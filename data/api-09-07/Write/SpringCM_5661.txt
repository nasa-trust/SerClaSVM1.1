Cloud-based enterprise content management service
SpringCM
The cloud-based enterprise content management platform allows applications to assemble customized services matched to specific needs. Available functions include configuring document-storage spaces, structured by user-defined folders and metadata, along with supporting workflow processes for updates, review, and publishing.

API methods support CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) for folders, documents, and descriptive metadata. Workflow methods provide for automation of repeatable processes, step status review, check-in/checkout of documents, and related functions.
