Online marketplace and store creation service
Storenvy
Storenvy assists in developing online stores for clients as well as aggregating independent online stores into a web marketplace with over 18,000 stores at present. Users can either open their own online store utilizing their tools and API or browse and shop through the growing directory.

The API is currently in private beta (request a beta invite).

Developers using the API can manage their storefront, monitor and control order fulfillments, and receive event notifications through a REST interface in a JSON format. The API fully supports OAUTH2 and allows developers to create useful third-party apps for Storenvy merchants. Utilizing the store???s API key, developers can also connect directly with their own store and augment its functionality.
