Airport activity and weather information service
FAA Airport Service
The service provides reports of known delays and other airport status from the FAA&#039;s Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). It also returns current weather reports from NOAA for the airport. 

Methods accept an IATA airport code and return a status message, reason for any flight delays, and average length of delays. Return data also includes the current weather forecast for the airport with update time local to that location.
