Hispanic micro-blogging service 
Blipea
Blipea is a website that was created to allows residents of other countries, particularly those in Honduras, to use services like Twitter and Facebook from their mobile devices by sending &quot;Blips.&quot;  The website is entirely in spanish, and the API is still in a very basic Beta format with limited developments. Current features allow posting Blips through API post calls.
