The 12seconds API provides developers with the ability to grab and mix content from the 12seconds site in a number of cool ways. This alpha release of the API is a set of simple HTTP requests to our API server that returns XML for your mashup pleasure. You can grab a single user&#039;s videos, the videos of that user&#039;s friends, metadata about a single video, and videos matching tags.
