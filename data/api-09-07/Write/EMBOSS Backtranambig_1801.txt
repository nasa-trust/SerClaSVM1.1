Protein to nucleic acid back-translation service
EMBOSS Backtranambig
The EMBOSS Backtranambig API reads a protein sequence input by the user and then writes the nucleic acid sequence it could have come from. To do so, it uses nucleotide ambiguity codes that represent all possible codons for each amino acid. The API is available in both RESTful and SOAP forms and responses are formatted in XML.
