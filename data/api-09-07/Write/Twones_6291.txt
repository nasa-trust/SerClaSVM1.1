Use the Tracker API to get your music site tracked on Twones if you offer music audio/video playback on your site. Twones is a music service that offers innovative ways to store, organize, find, and share music available online (YouTube, Myspace, Last.fm, Blogs) or on your computer (iTunes) to one place. Twones ties music together and lets you share with others. Contact to obtain docs.
