What was formerly the ECS - eCommerce Service - has been renamed the Product Advertising API. Through this API developers can retrieve product information. The API exposes Amazon&#039;s product data and e-commerce functionality. This allows developers, web site publishers and others to leverage the Amazon Product Discovery features that Amazon uses to power its own business, and potentially make money as an Amazon affiliate. Additionally, the API has features allowing developers to advertise proucts, let users search for Amazon products and help users discover Amazon products. Both REST and SOAP APIs are provided, this profile is for the REST API.
