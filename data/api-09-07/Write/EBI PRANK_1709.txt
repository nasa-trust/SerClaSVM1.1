Probabilistic multiple alignment service
EBI PRANK
PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA, codon, and amino-acid sequences. It also allows users to define a potential structure for sequences to be aligned to and predicts the locations of structural units in the sequences.

The EBI PRANK API provides access to these functions via SOAP and REST protocols.
