Hand-written thank you note service
ThankThank Notes
ThankThank Notes is a service that sends hand-written thank you notes to their clients&#039; customers. The thank you notes are customizable and can be sent individually or in bulk. 

The ThankThank Notes API is an alternative to ThankThank Notes web form. Instead of filling out a web form for each thank you note batch, the API allows clients to integrate ThankThank Notes functionality into their website and/or CRM system, so ThankThank Notes go out automatically as determined by the client.
