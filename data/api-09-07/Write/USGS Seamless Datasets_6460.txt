USGS Seamless Datasets
The USGS Seamless Datasets service is a collection of three API&#039;s that work in tandem to provide developers with a programmatic portal to the USGS Seamless and Tiled Server&#039;s data holdings. The Seamless Data Warehouse contains massive amounts of data compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) - two projects backed by the Department of the Interior to create, maintain, and allow access to geospatial data of the United States.

The first of these API&#039;s is the Inventory Service, a data discovery service that provides information about what data is available in the server over a particular area of interest.

The Request Validation Service uses dataset information generated by previous calls to the Inventory Service (including the user-defined area of interest) to verify and validate the informaiton, resulting in a fully parameterized URL or set of URL&#039;s that can be used by the download service.

The download service takes the parameterized URL(s) created by the Request Validation Service to initiate a request for data, query the system for request status updates, and finally return the requested data to the user in XML format.
