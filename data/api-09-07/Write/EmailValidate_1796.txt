Email address validation service
EmailValidate
The service validates email addresses via syntax analysis, lookup against MX records, and checks against SMTP availability. It reviews a submitted address list and validates the entries without sending email to the recipients, allowing clean-up of lists that does not risk damage to customer relationships. 

API methods support submission of email addresses  and return response codes and messages. Responses specify validity of address syntax, validity against MX records, and SMTP availability.
