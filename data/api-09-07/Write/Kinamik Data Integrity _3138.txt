Tamper evident and digital evidence ready data
Kinamik Data Integrity 
Kinamik&#039;s API enables tamper evidence to digital data in real-time.

The API allows developers to create strong cryptographic digital signatures on granular data records as they are received ensuring data cannot be interested, modified or deleted without it being detectable.   

The API handles any type of binary data including but not limited to audit log data, IMs, emails, files, digital audio and/or video surveillance feeds.  It pin points to any changed data whilst providing assurances of the rest of the data??s trustworthiness and ensuring its digital evidence readiness.  

Public documentation is not available; interested developers should contact info@kinamik.com.
