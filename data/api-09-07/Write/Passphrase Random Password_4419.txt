Random character generator password service
Passphrase Random Password
The service generates and returns a random password string that can be recorded as a user login credential and provided to the user for later access. One use case for this function would be the response to a forgotten password or password reset request initiated by the user.

API methods support submission of a simple request, which returns an alphanumeric string consisting of some combination of numerals 0-9 and uppercase or lowercase alphabetic characters. Methods also accept special requests, with the returned string also incorporating selected punctuation and special characters.
