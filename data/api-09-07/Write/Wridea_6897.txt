Idea tracking and brainstorming service
Wridea
The service logs ideas and provides tools for organizing, discussing, and refining them. Possible uses include brainstorming, document development, and online collaboration. Users can create a record for an idea under development, then give access to others for review, commentary, and refinement of initial concepts.

API methods support retrieval of pages and idea records created under a user account, along with management functions like adding, updating, and deleting. Methods also allow creation and management of categories for organizing idea and page records.
