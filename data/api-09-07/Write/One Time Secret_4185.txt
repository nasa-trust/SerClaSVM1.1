Secret link generator for sensitive information
One Time Secret
One Time Secret is an application that lets users copy and paste sensitive information, such as passwords, into a system that generates a secret link for them to share, instead of sharing the secret information over email.

The One Time Secret API allows developers to access and integrate the functionality of One Time Secret with other applications. Some example API methods include retrieving the status of the system, sending secret links, retrieving secret links, and retrieving metadata associated with secret links.
