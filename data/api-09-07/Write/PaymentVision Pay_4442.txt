Online credit card payment service
PaymentVision Pay
The service processes online payments, either one-time or recurring charges by credit card, debit card, or ACH charge against buyer bank account. It provides real-time authorization for payments processed. A token-based system for scheduled payments prevents the need to store card numbers or bank account data, maintaining PCI security compliance and preventing liability through data loss. 

API methods support completing one-time, same-day payments as well as scheduling recurring payments for time-based contracts. Methods also allow verification of bank account information and user update of payment account information.
