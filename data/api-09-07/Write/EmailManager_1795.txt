Email marketing and CRM synchronization system
EmailManager
The Emailmanager API is a way for you to be able to synchronize your customer base, CRM, CMS or shopping cart e-commerce with the EmailManager email marketing system. You no longer need to constantly import and export manually updated lists between EmailManager and its database; both lists are automatically synchronized. This API also performs list management functions, functions for creating and sending issues, and developers can also retrieve campaign statistics.

The EmailManager API, currently in Beta, provides data as XML, JSON or serialized PHP. Developers can use either a simple HTTP API or XML-RPC, where method calls are wrapped in XML.
