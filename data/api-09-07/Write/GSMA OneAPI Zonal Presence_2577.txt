The GSMA also produces industry-leading events such as the Mobile World Congress and Mobile Asia Expo.

The GSMA OneAPI is a set of APIs that expose network capabilities over HTTP. The OneAPI Zonal Presence interface allows a Web application to query a ???Zone???. A zone is a cluster of one or more Femtocells to which end user phones may be connected. With the Zonal Presence API you can determine the number of users in a zone, be notified of entries to/exits from the Zone, and the user path taken through the Femtocells in a Zone.
