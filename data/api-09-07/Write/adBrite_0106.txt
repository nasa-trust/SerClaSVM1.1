Online ad management service
adBrite
The service manages clients&#039; web and video advertising through an open exchange implementing an auction where advertisers and web publishers agree to place ads. A user page view triggers a call to the service, which determines which advertising offering best matches the page and delivers that ad. Clients can access tools to track their ad exposure, click rates, and conversion.

API methods support creating ad campaigns and defining criteria for matching them to content. The API also provides methods for reporting on and managing client accounts and ad campaigns.
