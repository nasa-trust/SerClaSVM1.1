Real estate listings and search service
Onboard Property Search
Onboard Informatics helps real estate, media, and technology companies provide answers to user questions through their Lifestyle Listings Engine. A suite of four APIs is provided.

The Property Search Engine XML API provides recent home sales to the consumer and gives insight in to how the local market is performing. This in turn gives the buyer or seller more data to analyze as they decide if they want to buy or sell a house. Based on a national database of over 30 million transactions, the API lets users search by address, zip code, lat/long or Property ID (unique to Onboard).
