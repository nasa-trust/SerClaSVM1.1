Geocoding of named places
Yahoo PlaceFinder
The Yahoo PlaceFinder API gives developers multi-language global geocoding of named places.

PlaceFinder supports building-level address recognition in over 75 countries, and points of interest, airports, cities, and other place names (including administrative areas) for these countries and the rest of the world.

In addition to supporting free-form, single-line, and multi-line address inputs, PlaceFinder also supports queries that include cross streets, WOEID, and IATA airport codes. It also supports reverse geocoding: you can give it a longitude/latitude coordinate and get back the nearest address.
