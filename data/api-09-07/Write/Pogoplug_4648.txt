Internet file access service
Pogoplug
The service gives internet access to the file system on a user&#039;s PC through a hardware dongle plugged into a USB port. That access allows retrieval and sharing of locally stored files from anywhere with web access. An iPhone application allows file access via cellphone networks.

API methods support CRUD (create, read, update, delete) control of files on a machine connected to the dongle. To enable that access, methods can list, search, retrieve, create, remove, and copy files.
