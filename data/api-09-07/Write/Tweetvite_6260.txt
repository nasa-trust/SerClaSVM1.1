Tweetup and event creation service
Tweetvite
Tweetvite allows users to create and find tweetups in the user&#039;s area. Tweetvite&#039;s features include customizable invites, tracking tweets and retweets about the tweetup, and listing of events for others to find.

The Tweetvite API is currently read-only. The API allows users to search and retrieve event information (guestlists, comments) and user profiles. Tweetvite plans to launch an API that users can write in the future.
