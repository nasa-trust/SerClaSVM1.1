Address-based geolocation services
eCoComa Geo
The eCoComa Geo API allows users to perform a variety of geolocation tasks. Users may retrieve accurate city and state information for a U.S. ZIP Code, or find the matching ZIP Code for a given address, city, and state. Users may also employ a function to find the distance between two U.S. addresses. Another function determines an internet visitor&#039;s country based on their IP address.
