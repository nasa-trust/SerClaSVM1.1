Google Save to Wallet
Google Wallet is a project that aims to digitally store things normally held in a physical wallet including credit and debit cards, coupons, loyalty cards, tickets, boarding passes, and more. The Save to Wallet APIs allow visitors to both bank and merchant websites to save payment cards and offers to Google Wallet. Banks have the ability to integrate any credit or signature debit card into Google Wallet. Merchants have the ability to publish offers that can be saved to Google Wallet from a their desktop or mobile website. The API is currently available only to partner merchants.
