Domain name information service
eCoComa Domain
The eCoComa Domain API allows users to retrieve information about a specific host from the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) or to find sites that are hosted by a specific IP address. Another function provides access to the whois service to check domain name availability or to find out who owns a particular domain name.
