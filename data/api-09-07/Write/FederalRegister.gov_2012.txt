The Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) jointly administer the FederalRegister.gov website. The OFR/GPO partnership is developing an unofficial XML-based edition of the daily Federal Register on this site. FederalRegister.gov is a fully open source project.
