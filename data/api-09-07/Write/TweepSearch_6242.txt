TweepSearch
Ever wondered how many of your Twitter followers are web developers? Paging through twenty at a time and looking at bios is too slow to be worth answering that question. Using TweepSearch, you can quickly find that answer??? and several others you???ll come up with after you see how easy it is. The TweepSearch API is available to developers wishing to query the TweepSearch database in a programmatic fashion. The RESTful API, like the website, supports a number of search operators, returns stemmed results unless otherwise specified, can search specific fields.
