Royalty-free music service
Musicshake
The service provides access to a library of over 10,000 music selections available for use online without payment of royalties. The library is populated with in-house samples and proprietary songs organized by genre, tempo, mood, etc. The service gives access to incorporate its music in slideshows, videos, Flash components, etc.

API methods support retrieval of selections by category, genre, mood, and tempo. Methods generate a songlist, which the application can then incorporate by ID either as an MP3 file or RTMP audio stream.
