Commission Junction
The Commission Detail Service is a REST-based API that enables advertisers and publishers to access real-time commission and item-detail data. Advertisers and publishers that wish to receive commission reporting updates in near real-time or to request new commission data on a regular basis can use this API to create in-house tools that access real-time commission data from the CJ network. Developers may search by any number of criteria including price, currency, country, serviceable area and UPC. A SOAP API is also available but will eventually be deprecated.
