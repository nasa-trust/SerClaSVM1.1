Mobile content publishing service
Aloqa 
The Aloqa Content Publisher API allows you to publish location-relevant content (a business directory, social network, dating site or any other relevant content useful for people on the go) by creating a ???channel??? on Aloqa instead of building and supporting mobile applications for the many phones out there.

REST API coming soon, now support of XML feeds only.
