social networking post tracking service
Tweet Marker
The service logs a user&#039;s accesses to Twitter via multiple platforms and tracks the last read tweet on any of them. This syncs access to a Twitter stream, allowing a user to continue reading where they left off, on any of the supported platforms.

API methods support identification of the specific user across multiple clients and platforms. Methods also mark the last tweet accessed under that user account and retrieve the user&#039;s timeline from that point forward.
