From their site: The JobCentral XML API can provide free and easy job content to websites without the need to bulk up on servers or develop search technology. JobCentral&#039;s API will run in the background providing search and job content seamlessly through the partner&#039;s domain. JobCentral&#039;s feed contains original jobs, no spam, no duplicates, only current openings, and direct application connections for jobs seekers to the corporate Applicant Tracking Systems. Sites will have the flexibility to geo-target for local jobs, military crosswalk capabilities are available and much more.
