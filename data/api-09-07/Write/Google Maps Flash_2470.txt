Flash-based mapping service
Google Maps Flash
The Google Maps API for Flash provides a new way to add interactive Google Maps to your website, using Adobe&#039;s Flash? plugin to display dynamic map content. This API lets Flex developers embed Google Maps in Flash applications. Similar to the JavaScript version, this ActionScript API provides a number of utilities for manipulating and adding content to maps through a variety of services, enabling you to embed robust, interactive maps applications on your website. The Google Maps API for Flash now supports 3D Maps. This API exists as a fully independent alternative to the existing JavaScript Maps API, and provides many of the features of that API while also adding the ability to mix Flash content with Google Maps.
