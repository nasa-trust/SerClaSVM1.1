Building-related geospatial data service
Onuma WFS
The Onuma Web Feature Service (WFS) provides access to Onuma&#039;s geospatial data resources. This includes the locations and features of buildings, along with other Building Information Modeling (BIM) data. Users can query a specific geographic area determined either by input coordinates or by a drawn area that forms a bounding box. This service also allows users to make Onuma data available to other web services and applications.

Onuma WFS is based on open standards established by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and operates over GET and POST protocols.
