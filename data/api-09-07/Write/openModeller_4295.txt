Ecological niche modelling service
openModeller
openModeller is a program for performing species niche modelling simulations. It does so by building a representation of the ecological requirements for a species and extrapolating those requirements into a geographical region. openModeller makes its ecological niche modelling functions available as a SOAP-based API to facilitate standardized online use.
