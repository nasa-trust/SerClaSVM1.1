Corporation accountability research service
CorpWatch
CorpWatch is a non-profit organization that uses investigative research and journalism to expose corporate malfeasance and to advocate for multinational corporate accountability and transparency. 

The CorpWatch API uses automated parsers to extract the subsidiary relationship information from Exhibit 21 of companies&#039; 10-K filings with the SEC and provides a free, well-structured interface for programs to query and process the data. Using the API users can access hundreds of thousands of formal names of public corporations, a consistent ID system for companies, locations associated with companies, subsidiary/parent relationships between companies, alternate and former names for companies and a link to the SEC filing. The API uses a RESTful interface and responses are formatted in either XML or JSON.
