Journal article metadata harvesting service
Open Archives Initiative
The Open Archives Initiative API provides a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. The API allows service providers to harvest article metadata from repositories using the OAI-PMH protocol so they can use the metadata in their services. OAI-PMH is composed of a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP.
