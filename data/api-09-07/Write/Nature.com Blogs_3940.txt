Nature.com Blogs
The Nature Publishing Group (NPG) is a publisher of scientific and medical information both in print and online. NPG publishes journals, online databases, and services across a variety of sciences and clinical medicine. Nature.com also hosts blogs from the Nature Network, publishing blogs written by in-house editors and journalists.

The Blogs API provides a programmatic interface to the Blogs indexing and aggregation services, giving developers tools to search blogs, posts, stories (collections of aggregated blog posts about a topic), and papers published or indexed by the Nature Network. This API exposes methods that support queries based on a variety of aspects such as content tag, keyword, and index metadata. This RESTful API returns data in JSON, though some queries support Atom/RSS and CSV formats.
