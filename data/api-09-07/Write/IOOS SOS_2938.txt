Coastal conditions information service
IOOS SOS
This API is the CO-OPS Implementation of IOOS (Integrated Ocean Observation System) SOS (Sensor Observation Service). IOOS is an online tool that allows users to access information on oceanic, coastal, and Great Lakes environments collected from sources that can include NOAA and other federal agencies, the IOOS Regional Associations, and potentially other national or international organizations.

With the IOOS SOS API, users can retrieve data on currents, water levels (preliminary, verified, and predicted), meteorology, water conditions, wave harmonics, sensors, and stations via HTTP GET/POST.
