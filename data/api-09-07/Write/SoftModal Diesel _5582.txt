Diesel fuel price information service
SoftModal Diesel 
The service republishes reports from the U.S. Department of Energy documenting retail prices for diesel fuel in a machine-readable format. DOE makes its weekly survey results for on-highway fuel prices available for bulk download but does not expose the data for application access. This service fills that gap to support planning for transportation fleet operations.

API methods support requests by date (defaulting to the current date) and region. It returns DOE&#039;s reported average price for survey results matching the request parameters.
