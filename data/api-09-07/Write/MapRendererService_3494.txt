Map rendering service
MapRendererService
MapRendererService is a SOAP-based API for rendering maps. Map rendering is the process of taking raw geospatial data and generating a visual map from it. The API can be used to retrieve map information, legends, and feature information. It also supports map geometry conversions. This API is poorly documented.
