UK education technology reporting service
JISC Monitoring Unit
The service is provided by the UK government organization that champions integration of technology within higher education. Its role includes overseeing technology initiatives it funds within UK colleges and universities, which file required reports tracking their service performance against established metrics. The Monitoring Unit provides access to reported data, both to JISC to measure service usage over time and to inform interested third parties.

API methods support search against the database of technology programs within institutions and sites monitored by JISC. Methods allow retrieval of summaries across sites or detailed reporting on individual sites.
