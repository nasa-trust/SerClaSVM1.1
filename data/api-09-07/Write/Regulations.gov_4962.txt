U.S. government regulations document repository
Regulations.gov
Regulations.gov is a website from the United States federal government for helping citizens access documents describing federal regulations. Government agencies post notices, rules, proposed rules and requests for comment on the site. Users can search by timeframe, keyword and type of document.

The Regulations.gov API provides developers with access to the same information on the website in a programmatic interface. Search documents, retrieve specific dockets or get document information. Developers can filter search results by date, agency, docket ID and comment period.

The full documentation is available on the site as a PDF linked from the footer. The API returns data as XML or JSON and requires an API Key available upon request.
