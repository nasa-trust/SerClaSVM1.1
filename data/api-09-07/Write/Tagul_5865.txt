Tag Cloud Creation Service
Tagul
Tagul is a service that can take an XML description of a tag cloud and turn it into an interactive tag cloud image. The Tagul API is an XML-RPC API for developers to use to generate tag clouds through their own interface, instead of using Tagul&#039;s web interface. The API is not free; it is available for a monthly fee.
